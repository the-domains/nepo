**Father Christmas.** Santa Claus.

Or, as I've always known him, Jeff. No. You're too short and bossy, and your nose is all funny. I know. _Dinosaurs_! On a spaceship! I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book.

Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool. Please tell me I didn't get old. Anything but old. I was young! Oh... is he grey?

> I need...I need...I need... fish fingers and custard!
